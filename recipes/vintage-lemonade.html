        In the 1800's this is how people made lemonade—you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <p><li>5 lemons</li></p>
        <p><li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li></p>
        <p><li>1 ¼ quarts water</li></p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li></p>
        <p><li>Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.</li></p>
        <p><li>Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.</li></p>
    </ol>
